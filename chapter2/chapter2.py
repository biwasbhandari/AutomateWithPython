The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as each other.
The = operator(assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable on the left.

and or not operates only one Boolean Value or expression. This makes it unary operator

Flow control statements often start with a part called the condition and are always followed by a block of code called the clause.
